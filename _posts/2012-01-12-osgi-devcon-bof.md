The programme for the Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session at OSGi DevCon 2012 -- co-hosted with EclipseCon 2012 -- has been [announced](https://www.osgi.org/DevCon2012/HomePage#bof). I will be speaking about the Java 8 module system, Jigsaw and how they relate to OSGi: what are the differences; the pros and cons of each in different environments; and the potential for them to work together.

There will also be sessions on: OSGi Subsystems; simplifying development with the upcoming OSGi Bundle Repository (OBR) standard; and finally a surprise session from a mystery speaker.

The BOF is free to attend, you don't need to be registered for OSGi DevCon/EclipseCon. So if you're in the Washington DC area and interested in learning more about OSGi or meeting several of the top OSGi experts... you know where to go.
