Recommendations (via LinkedIn)

"I was impressed by Neilâ€™s excellent technical skills and structured approach to problem solving. These combined with his creative thinking and innovative solutions mean I have no hesitation in recommending Neil to anyone looking for top quality IT Consultant."

"Neil was part of a highly professional team of consultants on site at a Bank in the City of London. He immediately fitted in and took responsibility for some important components of the application being developed. These components involved unusual mixture of server and client code, i18n and business functionality. Neil was fast to pick up the requirements and delivered on time and on budget great implementations. I do recommend him for his work and his team spirit. He is highly technical architect and thrives on innovation and lateral thinking."
