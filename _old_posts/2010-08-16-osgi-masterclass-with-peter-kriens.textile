"Peter Kriens":http://www.osgi.org/blog and I will be running an "OSGi Masterclass":http://www.aqute.biz/MasterClass/MasterClass in Girona, Spain from the 13th to 15th October 2010.

The course is intended to deepen your knowledge of all aspects of OSGi. It is very hands-on and will cover the following areas:

* How to think in Services
* Distributed OSGi
* Configuration
* Persistence
* GUIs
* etc.

The masterclass is preceded by an optional one-day introductory course on 12th October, for developers who need a refresher on some of the basics of OSGi. Both the introductory day and the masterclass are located in a beautiful "hotel near Girona":http://www.balneariovichycatalan.rolinesystem.com/home.asp.
